# Live Interview Agenda

- **Short introduction (~10 minutes).**

  First, we’ll introduce ourselves, so you know who you’re speaking to. 🙂 Then
  it’s your turn. We would like to know:

  - Your professional experience: how long have you been working? In which
    companies (big enterprises, small startups, etc)? With what technologies and
    methodologies (agile, waterfall, etc)?
  - What notable projects - work-related or personal - have you been working on?
    We’re especially interested if you’ve worked in the fintech, edtech, or
    social-network spaces.
  - Anything _you_ want us to know.

- **Take-home assignment review and pair programming (~50 minutes).**

  Together we'll review your take-home assignment, sharing what we liked about
  it, what we'd have liked to see, and in general asking you about how you
  approached it, why you implemented the way you did, etc.

  We’ll continue with a pair programming session, where we will ask you to take
  the lead, share your screen, and continue working on some part of the
  assignment.

  We don’t expect you to complete a certain amount of work in a set amount of
  time. It’s not a race! 🙂 We just want to see how you work, how you approach
  problems, how you communicate with colleagues, etc. You’re encouraged to
  “think aloud” during the session, ask clarifying questions and even ask for
  help if you don’t know how to do something. Of course, you can also use Google
  during the session.

- **General technical questions (~20 minutes).**

  We’ll ask you a series of technical questions in your areas of expertise. They
  could be very specific or very general. We don’t expect perfect answers, and
  “I have no clue” is also acceptable. 😉

- **Open feedback (~10 minutes).**

  If you’re up for it, we like to finish our interviews by openly sharing our
  impressions on how the interview went: what we liked about you, but also what
  our concerns were (if there were any).

  We will also ask you to give us feedback on the interview: did you like how it
  was structured, the take-home assignment, the questions we asked, etc? Did you
  feel like you could accurately demonstrate your professional experience? Don’t
  be afraid to be brutally honest; we want good feedback so we can improve our
  process. 🙂
