# Full-Stack Engineer Technical Interview

Welcome to the Female Invest technical interview! First of all, thank you for
taking the time to take it. We know it's a tedious and somewhat stressful
process, but alas, it's a necessary one. On our part, we'll try to make it as
smooth as possible for you and us as well.

The technical interview is divided into two parts:

1. **Take-home assignment.**

   The take-home assignment is a relatively short (max 4 hours) technical
   exercise that we ask you to complete on your own before coming in for the
   second part of the interview. The subject of the assignment depends on the
   role you're interviewing for. You can find assignments for the various roles
   in the [assignments](./assignments/) directory of this repository.

   Once you've completed the assignment, you should send it to us (in one way or
   another) so that we can take a look at it before we meet for the second part
   of the interview.

2. **Live interview with pair programming.**

   The second part of the technical interview is a ~90-minute live interview.
   Together we'll go through your take-home assignment and we'll ask you to pair
   with us on extending it in some way.

   The interview also includes a "questions round", where we'll ask you a series
   of general technical questions related to your role.
   [Here](./live-interview-agenda.md) you can find the detailed agenda for the
   live interview.

If you're reading this you've probably been sent here by one of our recruiters
after having gone through the first interview, and you're now ready to take the
technical interview. You've also probably been given an end date by which you
should send in your take-home assignment.

So well, you can now pick the assignment for your role from the
[assignments](./assignments/) directory and start working on it. ðŸ™‚

Good luck and talk to you soon!
